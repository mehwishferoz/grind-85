# Grind 85

Welcome to the Grind 85 repository! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to my 6-week intensive coding practice, where I will be solving and pushing C++ problems. The goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Schedule

I am committing to a rigorous schedule of 12 hours per week over the next 6 weeks. Here's the breakdown:

- **Total Duration**: 6 weeks
- **Weekly Commitment**: 12 hours
- **Total Hours**: 72 hours

## Contents

The repository will be organized as follows:

- **Week 1**
  - Two Sum
  - Problem 2
  - ...
- **Week 2**
  - Problem 1
  - Problem 2
  - ...
- **...**
- **Week 6**
  - Problem 1
  - Problem 2
  - ...

Each week, new problems will be added in their respective folders.

## Goals

1. Solve at least 85 problems by the end of 6 weeks.
2. Enhance problem-solving skills in C++.
3. Improve understanding of various data structures and algorithms.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
